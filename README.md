# User Experience (UX)

##
- The wireframe for this game/website is designed in [Miro](https://miro.com). The wireframe is a good referencs if you are unsure how to build or design your website. 
You can use it to structure up what you should do next for an example. A wireframe is recommended to create for every project you begin with.

## Color choice
I chose to make the colors very and basic. The game is an old and simple game, so it does not require alot of effects, and colors to make it fun to play.
The colors iv'e chosen are a gray-toned color for the background [background-color]()  green for win, red for lose and yellow if you tie a game.
This makes it user-friendly and very simple to understand for everyone!

# Testing

## Validator Testing 
PERFORMANCE was on 83. to solve this i checked on lighthouse what needed to get fixed. i got an input said: 
[FORM ELEMEN ERROR IMG]
[META DESCVRIPTIION IMG]
- I invesitgated my HTML and found out very quick that i forgot to put a label in my code.
So instead of my <span>, i placed a <label>, and a **for** attribute for every option.

- Afterwards, i checked the meta description, and added some keywords and a description on top of my page.

i ran the lighthouse again, and got a better result. [lightouse fixed img!()]
